C - Function pointers

General

    What are function pointers and how to use them
    What does a function pointer exactly hold
    Where does a function pointer point to in the virtual memory

files:

- function_pointers.h - The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function.
- 0-print_name.c - function that prints a name.
- 1-array_iterator.c - function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.
- 2-int_index.c - function that searches for an integer.
- 3-calc.h - This file should contain all the function prototypes and data structures used by the program.
- 3-op_functions.c - This file should contain the 5 following functions (not more):

    op_add: returns the sum of a and b. Prototype: int op_add(int a, int b);
    op_sub: returns the difference of a and b. Prototype: int op_sub(int a, int b);
    op_mul: returns the product of a and b. Prototype: int op_mul(int a, int b);
    op_div: returns the result of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_div(int a, int b);
    op_mod: returns the remainder of the division of a by b. Prototype: int op_mod(int a, int b);
- 3-get_op_func.c - This file should contain the function that selects the correct function to perform the operation asked by the user. Youâ€™re not allowed to declare any other function.
- 3-main.c - This file should contain your main function only.

    You are not allowed to code any other function than main in this file
    You are not allowed to directly call op_add, op_sub, op_mul, op_div or op_mod from the main function
    You have to use atoi to convert arguments to int
    You are not allowed to use any kind of loop
    You are allowed to use a maximum of 3 if statements
